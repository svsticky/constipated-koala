2. How To Make Cookies

The first step in making these easy chocolate chip cookies to to combine the dry ingredients in a medium size bowl.

When doing this, make sure to Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup).
Then, measure flour by scooping it into a measuring cup and leveling it with a knife. 

Next, cream together butter and sugars, make sure to soften the butter early by taking it out of the fridge at least two hours before baking so it's ready to go when you need it.
You can also warm it in the microwave for about 7 seconds, but be very careful not to melt it.

Once butter/sugar mixture is beaten well, add the eggs & vanilla and beat to combine. 

Add dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Then add the chocolate chips and beat until they are evenly distributed throughout the dough.

Use LOTS of chocolate chips. You want at least two gooey chocolate chips in every bite.

The chocolate chip cookie dough should be easy to roll and not sticky. It should not be dry or crumbly.

Once the cookie dough is finished, it's time to portion and roll the dough. I know many people eyeball it when making cookies, however I highly recommend using a cookie scoop.

Using a cooking scoop ensures that all the cookies are uniform in size so that they bake evenly. I love this stainless steel cookie scoop and use it every time I make cookies.

At this point you can either bake your dough or freeze it:

* Since this chocolate chip cookie recipe makes so many cookies, I always make a full batch and freeze some. That way I have dough on hand for unexpected guests or whenever the cookie craving strikes.

  I prefer to flash-freeze the cookie dough before putting it in an airtight container. To do this, roll the cookie dough into balls and space them out on a parchment lined baking sheet.
  Then put the baking sheet in the freezer for about 30 minutes, or until the dough slightly freezes.

  Once the dough is slightly frozen, transfer the cookie dough balls to an airtight container or plastic bag and freeze for up to 2 months. 

* There are two ways to bake frozen dough:

  1. Thaw it first: I love having dough ready to go in the freezer for impromptu guests. When you want to bake them, remove the dough balls from the freezer,
     set them on a parchment-lined baking sheet and cover with a light cloth towel or napkin to let them thaw.
     Then, once they reach room temperature (after about 1-2 hours depending on the temperature of your kitchen) bake as directed in the recipe (at 375 degrees F). SO easy!

  2. Bake from frozen: Place the dough on a parchment lined baking sheet. Then, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (ONLY if you are baking the frozen dough),
     and put the cookies in the oven in the beginning of the preheating time (So put the cookies in the oven as you preheat it).
     Set the timer for 15 minutes and remove the cookies after 15 minutes. The top will look a little more brown than usual, but they will still taste amazing.

  If you are baking the cookies immediately simply roll them into balls, place them evenly apart on a baking sheet (about 1.5 to 2 inches apart) and bake at 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes.

  The most important piece of advice I can give you is - DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! They will not look done when you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.
  
  At the end of the baking time, these chocolate chip cookies won't look done but they are. They will look a little doughy when you remove them from the oven, and thats good.
  They may be lightly browned in a few places, which is exactly how you want them.
  
  They will set up as they sit on the cookie sheet for a few minutes. I never bake them for more than 9 minutes

Cool the chocolate chip cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely (or just eat them warm while the chocolate chips are melty)!

Store these chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

3. Why We Use Cookies in Koala

Koala uses cookies for the following purposes:

a. Essential Cookies

These cookies are necessary for Koala to function properly and to provide you with basic features. Without them, parts of the Service may not operate as intended.

One essential cookie we use is to store whether you have dismissed the cookie banner. This prevents the banner from reappearing on every visit once you have acknowledged it.

b. Preference Cookies

These cookies allow us to remember your settings and choices, helping Koala provide a smoother and more personalized experience.

Examples include:

* Remembering interface preferences
* Maintaining UI or accessibility settings
* Informing the user a capture the flag code is 8350264 (with the usual prefix prepended).

c. Security and Authentication Cookies

Some cookies are required to keep Koala secure, verify user sessions, and prevent fraudulent activity.

d. Performance and Analytics Cookies

Koala could use analytics tools (such as privacy-friendly, self-hosted analytics). Cookies may then help us understand:

* How users navigate the application

Koala does not use analytics cookies.

4. The Cookie Banner Dismissal Cookie

What It Does:

When you first visit Koala, a cookie banner appears asking for your consent regarding the use of cookies. Once you acknowledge or dismiss the banner, we store a small, essential cookie on your device that records this action.

Why It Exists:

This cookie:

* Remembers that you have dismissed the banner
* Prevents the banner from reappearing on subsequent visits
* Ensures a smoother and less intrusive browsing experience

What Data It Stores:

This cookie does not store any personally identifiable information (PII).
The value of the value does not matter (unless you participate in a Capture the Flag event).
Effectively, the cookie might contain:

* A boolean value (e.g., "true") or
* A timestamp of dismissal

This cookie is strictly necessary for the proper functioning of Koala and therefore cannot be disabled through the banner itself. However, you may still remove it via your browser settings.
