    # We set this service up to run on a nonstandard port, so that we don't
    # interfere with a possibly already running Mariadb instance.
    # Port 25838 = the digits above "STICK" on a keyboard.
    # You are then able to connect using this command:
    # mysql -P 25838 -u root -p
    ports:
      - "25838:3306"

    # Configuration for how to connect, this should match Koala's config in
    # ./config/database.yml!  See here for possible values:

    environment:
      # We run Koala as the root user so that it can do anything it wants with

      # development, test databases and grant permissions on it.

    # The .dev-database-conf directory contains a configuration file which
    # enables extra features in MariaDB that we require. This directive
