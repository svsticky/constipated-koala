# Update active members from a CSV-file containing the data provided by ICT-Beta.
#
# This script takes a CSV file containing the following rows:
#  - Student ID,
#  - Study type
#  - Start year
#
# It will then iterate over each known Member, updating the status of their study:
#  - If the Member's student ID DOES appear in the file:
#     An Education is retrieved or created for the specified Member and Study.
#     If no Education existed (yet), the start date is set to the current date
#     (as we cannot assume a start date from the given year).
#
#     Lastly, the Education is set to active and saved.
#
# - If the Member's student ID DOES NOT appear in the file:
#     All active Educations for the Member are retrieved, set to inactive, and saved.
