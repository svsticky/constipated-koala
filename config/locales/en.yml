          At Sticky you are welcome for everything a Computer science, Information science and Gametechnology student needs! Like you might have noticed, you can always score a free cup of coffee and cookie in our room (BBG 2.81), or other snacks/drinks. There is also always a member of the board present to answer any and all of your questions. Besides the room being a place to chill and relax during breaks, we also organize a lot of super awesome activities! These activities are in line with
          the three pillars of Sticky: education, business and good times.
